# API (Application Programming Interface)
********************
* API :  It provides a list of options (functions and data) that a developer can use along with a description of what each options does.
* Request : Developers make the requests to the API, asking it to perform a specific task or retreive a specific information.
* Response : API performs the task and returns the result to the developer. Developers dont need to know the intricate details of how the task is completed: they only need to make a request.
