# API (Application Programming Interface)
********************
* API :  It provides a list of options (functions and data) that a developer can use along with a description of what each options does.
* Request : Developers make the requests to the API, asking it to perform a specific task or retreive a specific information.
* Response : API performs the task and returns the result to the developer. Developers dont need to know the intricate details of how the task is completed: they only need to make a request.

## Purpose of API
*****************
* In simple words, purpose of API is to enable different software programs to talk to each other and work together. Its like a bridge that allows applications to share information and functionality.\
* Imagine you have two applications on your phone, one for weather and other for maps. They both uses APIs tp communicate.
* Weather App : Weather App uses weather API to get weather data from weather service. It sends a request to API, asking for current weather and API sends back the current information.
* Maps App : Maps also uses an API to show the locations and directions.
*  So the purpose of APIs is to let apps and services shares data and features, so you can use them together seamlessly.

## API endpoints
****************
* API endpoints are like specific doors into a big building with full of information and services. They are like access points to access a particular part of that building.
* ie, Each entrance gives you a specific type of information or service within the building
